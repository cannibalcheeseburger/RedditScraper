Speed (1994): 10-Category Review
Speed honors its title. Despite lacking true depth or originality, Speed succeeds because it's efficient. The film unloads tons of action, but there's enough character development to maintain investment and prevent exhaustion. The story starts by introducing the protagonist, villain, and atmosphere through a smaller conflict. From there, viewers receive calmer character moments before jumping into the main course. Once Speed gets going, it's a steady series of obstacles with emotional breaks. Plus, Reeves has some dramatic outbursts, Bullocks is charming, and Hopper is fascinatingly deranged. Overall, Speed pushes the limits, but never crosses the line.

Meanwhile, Speed is technically charged. First, the effects are emphasized. Full of real stunts and explosions, Speed is refreshingly tangible. Also, miniatures help increase scope without sacrificing realism. Next, the editing is dynamic yet controlled. Speed is visually clear and properly constructed. The sound is complex because it's in a constant state of action, and the direction successfully blends a digestible tone. Speed could've easily felt insincere or overly cheesy, but it lands as endearingly ridiculous. Furthermore, the cast is quite impressive in hindsight. Ultimately, Speed stays in its lane and does its job. It's shallow entertainment done right.

Panic Room (2002) movie review
It’s the second film in my anniversary rewatch for the week, and is a smartly written and well acted thriller movie, that I’m happy to have seen. Locking yourself and your daughter in a panic room, should be relatively low tension and risk averse, but they do well to inject tension and add stakes through the characters actions. David Koeep wrote the film, and has written or helped to write such films as, Jurassic Park, Carlito’s Way, Mission Impossible, Spider-Man and some not so good films like Indiana Jones 5 and Tom Cruise’s, The Mummy.

Ambulance (2022): 10-Category Review
Ambulance is clumsy yet entertaining. Although he's reaching for more, Michael Bay is blunt. First, the characters are cliched. Abdul-Mateen is a veteran father with financial struggles, Gyllenhaal is a psycho with a soft spot, and Gonzalez is a jaded paramedic. Development is nice, but each role is completely generic (as is their dialogue). Plus, the entire narrative is contrived. Each procedural plot point is really an excuse for explosions. Furthermore, Ambulance is occasionally tiring because too many threads are woven in. Streamlining the ancillary characters would've helped. Still, the lead actors elevate the material, even if they're sometimes repetitive.

Meanwhile, Ambulance is technically engaged. In fact, it's moderately overdone. Fortunately, the effects are elaborate and practical. Also, the complex sound gets abstract, music is utilized for refreshing levity, and the core cast is excellent. However, the visuals are equally cinematic and chaotic. The camerawork is active, but drone shots and shaky cams are often disorienting. This is exacerbated by turbulent editing. Action sequences are energized, but also unclear. Additionally, the runtime is simply overindulgent. Ambulance looses steam because it's inefficient. Ultimately, Ambulance is a decent attempt that viewers will want to like, but it's also fairly messy.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016): 10-Category Review
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is messy, yet decent. Although it's weakened by distracting storylines, the core premise of capturing beasts is enjoyable. Fittingly, Redmayne is more comfortable around animals than humans, which is heartfelt and vulnerable. Plus, Fogler and Sudol are lovable outsiders of their own. Unfortunately, whenever Fantastic Beasts visits plotlines outside these main protagonists, the film suffers. Grindelwald, politics, and Ezra Miller just aren't as fun. Also, those ancillary threads don't gel with the small adventures of creature hunting. Clearly, Fantastic Beasts had duel intentions, and because of that, the film is diluted. 

Meanwhile, the technicals of Fantastic Beasts are solid. Just the editing is questionable due to its stumbling momentum. Besides that, however, the craft is proficient. The cinematography uses engaging movement, the sound is complex, and the effects are comprehensive. Furthermore, the music incorporates the iconic Potterverse tune and some era-appropriate melodies. Yet, it's the production design that stands out for cohesively blending fantasy with period piece. Both elements synergize to create immersion. Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a fun movie that's held back by superfluous narratives. It's satisfactory, but would've been better as its own thing.

An Analysis of Reservoir Dogs Part 1
Reservoir Dogs was made in 1992 and is the first film directed by the acclaimed Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. The film follows a group of criminals in the aftermath of a jewellery heist gone wrong.

The first scene in Reservoir Dogs is particularly magnificent as it not only reveals to the audience the type of characters these men are, but shows Tarantino's signature type of dialogue in the first scene of his first movie (Not including True Romance). The scene takes place in a diner of sorts with the 'Dogs' sitting around a table having a casual conversation about Madonna's "Like a Virgin". Mr Brown leads the conversation claiming the song is about a promiscuous woman who has sex with a man with a big dick, and thus reminding her of when she lost her virginity. It is here where we are first exposed to Tarantino dialogue. The conversation taking place has no effect on the plot yet adds a layer of realism as the characters talk about pop culture. Where most films will only use dialogue for character development or to further the plot, Tarantino cleverly makes a conversation have no effect on the film yet is instantly relatable as conversations such as these take place on a daily basis. We as the audience are interested in the conversation as it seems natural and funny. During this conversation, a smaller minor conflict arises between Mr White and Joe Cabbot (Keitel and Tierney.) As Joe is reading names out of a book Mr White snatches the book from him after becoming frustrating with Cabbot's constant muttering which leads to a minor argument between the two. Neither side wants to back down and it is here where the climax of the movie is foreshadowed. They settle down the argument as Joe goes to pay for the breakfast and leaves the others to make the tip. Everybody contributes a dollar except Mr Pink which he explains by saying he doesn't believe in tipping for no reason. He believes that if a waitress really deserves a tip, then and only then should she be tipped. This is where many of the characters reveal their true intentions. Mr Pink argues in what most would consider a selfish manner with little empathy, this foreshadows his later attitudes toward the Dogs as shit hits the fan as he would be the one to obsess over the diamonds, be the one to refuse to take Mr Orange to a hospital to prevent himself from risk and ultimately be the most level headed of the Dogs. Mr White takes the "honour amongst thieves" approach and stands up for the waitresses, (much like he will stand up for Mr Orange later) explaining waitressing is a difficult job and is the only salvation for female non-college graduates. But Mr Oranges reaction is by far the most intriguing. Mr Orange then agrees with Mr Pink and asks for his dollar back. Mr Orange is a cop and him agreeing with Mr Pink is a way to maintain his cover and act like the other crooks and mimic their philosophies, and as Joe Cabbot returns to collect the tips, and asks who didn't put in a dollar, it is Mr Orange who rats him out. This one scene is cinema at its finest, a work of art and much like Tarantino's other work, incredibly unique. Then the title sequence begins to "Little Green Bag" by the George Baker Selection and quite possibly the coolest sequence of all time happens.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022): 10-Category Review
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is average, an example of modern popular movies. It's based on a recognized franchise, its main concern is merchandising, and its craft is mediocre. The narrative is irrelevant because its purpose is to put Sonic into action, introduce new characters, and leave room for a sequel. Motivations are flimsy, Marsden's plotline is pointless, and themes are hollow. Furthermore, there are excessive pop culture references. It's nice that Sonic 2 adopts the video game adventure and lore, but that still results in generic MacGuffins and nonsensical backstories. The cast has fun, but can't transform stale tropes into something fresh. 

Meanwhile, Sonic 2's filmmaking is inconsistent. The sound captures complex battles, alien voices, and the cartoonish tone. The cast is enhanced by Elba. Because this sequel goes bigger, the effects are more involved and the production embraces Sonic's universe (though blatant product placements persist). However, the music is utilized for comedy, yet is otherwise forgettable. Plus, there isn't a single interesting shot, and the final act sags due to an overextended runtime. Furthermore, Sonic 2 attempts more drama (which is commendable) but doesn't successfully blend that with its silly mood. Overall, Sonic 2 is watchable, but void of style or substance.

Blade (1998): 10-Category Review
Blade is amusing. It's cheesy and dated, but also competent. First, the writing is efficient. Blade's backstory is explained quickly and the narrative jumps right into his vampire hunting. Next, the R rating suits the edgy mood. Also, all the characters have motivation and purpose. Blade is out for revenge, Whistler is a role model, Dr. Jenson creates antidotes, and Frost is an insecure outcast among the vampire elite. Dialogue is cringey, some plot points are nonsense, and Blade's character is inconsistent, but this is forgivable because Blade is having fun with itself. It lacks depth, but Blade provides enough to be enjoyable.

Technically, Blade is proficient. The sound is sometimes unconvincing, but that's offset by complex combat and symbolically muted sequences. The excessive leather is corny, yet also trendsetting. Plus, the gory atmosphere is refreshing from a superhero movie. The editing has energetic fights, measured emotions, and occasional creativity (though, the runtime could've been trimmed). The CGI has aged poorly, but the practical effects are welcome. Also, the imagery captures action clearly and includes dramatic framing. Overall, Blade has engaging sequences (especially the intro), a balanced tone, and enthusiasm. It isn't a masterpiece, but Blade is fair entertainment.

Cube (1997) movie review
The Cube is a really interesting science fiction movie, it’s been followed with two sequels and a Japanese remake. (which I’ve yet to see). I had first seen this three or four years ago, and in a sea of science fiction movies that often fail to be innovative, Cube really helped to innovate what the Saw franchise would later produce for a larger viewing audience.

The Big Lebowski (1998): 10-Category Review
The Big Lebowski is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Seemingly pointless, it combines several methods into a sly blend. It's a comedy, but also exhibits western and noir attributes as The Dude navigates his entanglements. Meanwhile, the film sneaks in relevant social and political classism critiques. Plus, this is all unified by spiritual messages of surrender. These ingredients could've been messy, but the Coens find balance, subtly suggesting themes with potent details. Furthermore, the cast wholly embodies their eccentric characters. Thus, The Big Lebowski is a thoughtful journey that, fittingly, can be enjoyed without noticing its undertones.

Technically, The Big Lebowski has cunning style. The precise direction captures an outlandish atmosphere and nonchalant tone. It rarely feels overtly artistic, yet there's a lurking sense of deeper meaning. The visuals provide hypnotic transitions, elaborate dreams, and dramatic montages. These moments are further supported by careful editing, which also keeps the runtime tight and punctuates comedy. The sound is symbolically abstract, the production is iconic, and the effects heighten the surrealism. Lastly, the music fuses humor with thematic weight. Overall, The Big Lebowski is a joyful and deceptively substantial experience, definitively earning its modern classic status.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (2010): 10-Category Review
The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 doesn't commit. After Half-Blood Prince's wholly brooding yet beautiful atmosphere, it seemed like the Potterverse had evolved. However, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 relapses because it isn't fundamentally driven by emotions. Despite its bleak narrative, it's an adventure with tonally inconsistent solutions. That rocky blending of lightheartedness with maturity is a key downgrade. Plus, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is an incomplete episode because it lacks an ending. No core themes or issues are resolved. Some will forgive that since it's a series, but all films should have individualized conclusions (early Potterverse is a great example). 

Similarly, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is technically proficient but not peak Potterverse. Particularly, despite pretty establishing shots, the visuals are missing suggestive composition and angle variety. The editing has effective smash inserts, but an unnecessary runtime. Also, the production is a step down due to Hogwarts' absence. Conversely, the music matches the prospective mood, the elaborate effects are complimentary, and the sound symbolically builds tension. Plus, the cast is more comprehensive. Overall, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is well crafted and surely a positive experience. It's just not the best that the Potterverse has to offer.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009): 10-Category Review
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is peak Potterverse. It fully accepts its darker tone, bringing harmony to the experience. The technicals remain strong (possibly the strongest yet), the writing is consistent, and the acting is noticeably vulnerable. The theme is focused, the loss is genuinely painful, and the storylines converge neatly. Its ending feels slightly incomplete because the story isn't a standalone, but that's forgivable since everything else is effectively written. Plus, Rickman and Felton are layered, Gambon shows pain, and Radcliffe delivers a ranged performance. A welcome departure from its lighthearted beginnings, Half-Blood Prince embraces itself.

Meanwhile, Half-Blood Prince is technically skilled. Overall, it's the filmmaking culmination of the series. The visuals use framing, motion, composition, color, angles, and focus to produce an artistic mood. The effects and production are powerfully immersive. The editing is efficient and occasionally stylish (though some transitions needed establishing shots). Also, the sound is atmospheric and abstract. Lastly, the music highlights the melancholy tone and mystical reality. In ways, this is the most impressive Harry Potter film because it's so cohesive. Merging art with entertainment, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince should please all audiences.

Bridgeton First Season Review
Today, let’s talk about “Bridgerton”, but the first season, this one is when Gossip Girl and Downton Abbey combine to become a salacious affair. The lives of 1813 London’s high society have shaken off the expected gilded etiquette to showcase an even more competitive and deceptive side. Based on the novels by Julia Quinn, the Netflix show adapts the book series and expands it even further into a must-watch drama. With refined costumes, opulent settings, and torrid love affairs, Bridgerton packs a powerful punch!

Bridgerton focuses on the lives of competing wealthy families in London’s high society. Framed around the debut of the Bridgerton family’s eldest daughter Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), the series explores several threads of how the Bridgerton children deal with life during the season as debutantes are brought to court. The matches being made, the mind games to build (or destroy) pairings, the secret hook-ups hiding in the shadows, everything is on the table in their pursuit to land a perfect match. Rounding out the stories include the Featheringtons’ growing troubles during the season, Lady Danbury’s (Adjoa Andoh) mission to get the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page) engaged, and the Queen’s (Golda Rosheuvel) invested interest in making this an entertaining debutante season.

In addition to the festivities, there is the looming threat of Lady Whistledown, a mysterious writer releasing scandalous articles about London’s wealthy and elite. A various point throughout the season, Lady Whistledown comments about the developments during the parties, events, and “she” plays an important role in how high society views potential scandals. Some of Bridgerton’s most shocking revelations and plot developments come at the hands of Lady Whistledown, and uncovering the mysterious writer is a juicy mystery that pulls you in.

One of Bridgerton’s strengths comes from the visual appeal. Bridgerton is designed head-to-toe in period outfits and sets to suit the era of the story. A lot of detail is put into the series to make it feel grand and opulent (I would be shocked at the budget for the series!). And, many modern touches are incorporated that are adapted for the time, like adapting current popular music into orchestral songs for the parties and dances. For example, there’s a beautiful rendition of Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” that is used for one of the first dances between Daphne and the Duke of Hastings. These choices feel fresh and add an unconventional spin to the era.

And we can’t talk about Bridgerton without mentioning the salacious sex appeal. Bridgerton incorporates the occasional sex scene and nudity to shake things up and play off the taboo nature within London’s high society. While surprising in parts, the inclusion didn’t feel unnecessary or added for the sheer shock value alone. Here, Bridgerton utilizes those uninhibited scenes to reflect how their characters are going against their societal expectations or when they’ve unleashed themselves from their refinement. And when they do, the characters act more primetime soap than daytime.

Daphne’s story has the most weight and progression; her debutante season affects the surrounding characters, whether it be her family, her friends, or her suitors. The tale of a pair lying about their romantic pursuits to hook in other matches has been done to death in other TV shows/movies, and while the idea is a bit cliché, the chemistry between her and the Duke of Hastings is so powerfully captivating. You can’t help but root for something to develop between them — they’re electric whenever they’re throwing playful barbs at one another. No one compared to their chemistry; their journey is a strong story to follow.

The same goes for Lady Danbury’s involvement. Adjoa Andoh stole the show whenever she was on-screen; she commanded attention and you could tell she had a lot of fun playing the sharp-witted matchmaker. The Queen and the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) also lived for their roles too – while both are vastly different, they take to debutante season quickly and enjoyably.

The first season of Netflix’s Bridgerton delivered a deliciously fun time full of British refinement and soapy scandals. The plots hooked us in and the characters kept us coming back for more. With the exception of a few glaring holes and missteps, the season shined as a whole. It is not a secret that we are overusing the inclusivity in the majority of the modern productions, however, this series select the characters in a way it is not uncomfortably forced to watch. Well done this time Netflix.

Rate: 9/10

Are There Any Good Horror Icons in Modern Cinema? (2010's and Beyond)
 Who would you say is the modern horror equivalent of the icons of the past like Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and even later on with Ghostface and Jigsaw? Do you think there are ANY newer examples that match their level of iconography? Because I really don't, unfortunately; in my opinion the idea of the "horror icon" has kind of died out in today's films. What are your thoughts on this theory? Does it even matter? Maybe we've just moved on from masked killers and the genres evolved or maybe there's just less creativity.resulting in less memorable villains? Let me know what you think.   And while you're at it maybe check out my video essay which goes in depth on the topic: "The DEATH of Horror Icons" which can be found here; [https://youtu.be/QmxQ3C8b1rM](https://youtu.be/QmxQ3C8b1rM?fbclid=IwAR2d6-6_XJwDcytfIYjnHOpk8H8_Z7c-3OdUbOQygnpRfD4C1UN2ZQ68vJU)

Morbius (2022): 10-Category Review
Morbius is wasted space. The entire movie is filler, stalling until the inevitable superpower acquisition and the showdown with the hollow villain. It's baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming because Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and the final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to relate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a sore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless. 

Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is adequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music is a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of blood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and cluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesn't have direction. There isn't a tone, message, or passion driving this film. It's completely stale and clearly a cash grab. Viewers beware.

Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022): 10-Category Review
Everything Everywhere All at Once is stunning. It's a corky spectacle, but remains deeply vulnerable. The narrative follows Evelyn, whose business and personal relationships are failing. Plus, Evelyn is unexpectedly tasked with saving the entire multiverse as her personal life bursts. This story might sound familiar, but it develops into an unparalleled blend of comedy, action, adventure, and drama. Each role is compelling, the conflict is relatable, the arcs are earned, and the plot devices are utilized to their fullest. Furthermore, the entire cast displays a wide range of skills: switching characters, blending tones, and striking beats in a symphony of emotions.

Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once is masterfully crafted. Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is marvelous because it fuses so much into a cohesive experience. In other hands, it would be a mess, but Everything Everywhere All at Once works beautifully.

Flee (2021): 10-Category Review
Flee is powerful. It's deeply heartbreaking because it addresses hard truths. Flee is the story of Amin, a refugee who escapes war-torn Afghanistan. His family immigrates to Russia, where they're still oppressed. From there, they attempt to reach salvation in Sweden. Along the way, Amin's family is abused and separated. His story addresses corruption, trafficking, and the lasting effects of trauma, yet remains grounded in personal relationships. Also, Amin's interviews are extremely vulnerable. He clearly hasn't opened up this much before, and his honest perspective is a genuine gift. Therefore, Flee is incredibly moving and truly illuminating.

Meanwhile, Flee is creatively delivered. Choosing to depict Amin's stories through animation, Flee feels timeless and universal. Animation is frequently a lighthearted medium, so it juxtaposes the horrors of its content. Meanwhile, this frees up the cinematography and editing for artistic expression. The sound has a deeper impact because it's the only literal connection to Amin. Plus, the style of the drawings changes depending on the clarity of the memory. It's this intentional look and expression of the animation that sets Flee apart and serves its messages. Ultimately, Flee isn't for the faint of heart, but will enlighten those who view it.

The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2021): 10-Category Review
The Eyes of Tammy Faye is confidently produced and brilliantly performed. Its straightforward story highlights corruption and prejudice without feeling heavy-handed. Plus, this script delicately balances its characters. The Eyes of Tammy Faye portrays its protagonists with flawed humanity, allowing viewers to conclude for themselves. Still, this film's driving force is its acting. Cherry Jones is good (evolving her internal conflict), Andrew Garfield is great (masking insecurities with bravado), and Jessica Chastain is electric (blending inner strength, devout faith, and mounting pain). Undoubtedly, these three (especially Chastain) transformed a solid movie into a true event.

Meanwhile, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is well crafted. Montages can be shortcuts, but these purposefully convey information, atmosphere, and artistry. The sound design is muted during emotional moments, expressing Tammy Faye's isolation. The music recontextualizes gospel, juxtaposing Tammy Faye's celebrity success and personal struggles. Also, the cinematography employs camerawork, framing, and focus to keep the film fresh. Lastly, the production design elaborately carries the audience through eras with detailed sets, costumes, prosthetics, and make-up. Overall, The Eyes of Tammy Faye is a thorough film with noticeable strengths, making it well worth a watch.

The Batman: Nope, didn't like it.
 Finished watching “The Batman” on HBO Max tonight. ”Finished” because I had started it yesterday and just could not get through all three hours in one sitting. Of all the movies with compelling storylines, engaging character development, and captivating dialogue, this was definitely not one of them. It was the poseur of all of those things, shoving a gritty cinema verité and semi-realistic action scenes in the viewer’s face as sophomoric hubris, a film student who finally discovered sidelighting and shadow and cannot wait to abuse the tropes of manufactured emotional darkness.

The film itself has been wildly popular with most of the public, proof to me that the general audiences are easily fooled by moody actors into thinking they have witnessed storytelling or content worth mulling over. To be fair, the concept itself was clever; take the fantastic world of unrealistic superheroes and supervillains and bring them down to Earth, much as 2019’s “The Joker” had done. My comment to Warner Bros and DC Comics: please stop doing that. There are plenty of realistic movies to watch. I want my superheroes to be super, not secular. In fact, there’s nothing *less* realistic than real people doing parkour with pointy ear cowls; it’s the excess of a proper super character that makes them more believable. Pattison’s single brooding expression does little to unfold a character of interest and I was even hoping he would start sparkling at some point just to lessen my disgust.

All that aside, what truly irks me about this latest iteration is the “done dirty” that happened to Zack Snyder and the butchering of “Justice League” at the hands of Joss Whedon (whom I normally think the world of and am confused by the hamfisted editing he did). Ben Affleck was the most interesting and even relatable Batman of all, and the way the character had developed through “Batman vs Superman” was finally doing the world-building that DC had sorely lacked in comparison to the MCU. Snyder’s “Justice League” had spread the sort of tableau of interconnected potential stories that it left me wanting so much more… and all of that discarded when the disconnected fools at Warner Bros decided to drop a big deuce of “another direction”. It’s beyond frustrating, it’s a tragedy.

Is “The Batman” watchable? Barely so. Is it re-watchable? Only if you pay me. That was three hours of my time that could have been spent re-watching “Thor: Ragnarok” or even surfing YouTube for talking husky videos instead.

Father Stu (2022): 10-Category Review
Father Stu presents a loaded topic with mixed execution. It has uniqueness, but Father Stu undercuts that with generic mistakes. Specifically, Stuart Long's rebellious expression of Catholicism is accessible to non-believers. Unfortunately, that’s supported by slim philosophy and insincere resolutions. Father Stu takes viewer buy-in for granted and focuses on unearned inspiration to simulate progression. This contrived writing squanders the refreshing protagonist. Therefore, instead of reaching skeptics (like Long was known for), Father Stu preaches to the choir. Plus, Wahlberg's casting is overpowering. He's good, but the faint material is overshadowed by his persona.

Technically, Father Stu is decent, yet bland. Its positives are the energetic music, involved aging make-up, and symbolic sound. Conversely, the visuals are completely uninteresting. There's one meaningful upside-down shot, but that's it. Furthermore, the editing is equally basic, never heightening drama or thematic energy. Thus, the film blurs into a vague series of events, feeling less impactful than they should. Also, the third act drags because the film isn’t paced or structured. Overall, the filmmaking has virtues, but fails to create a clear tone or emotional arc for audiences. Consequently, Father Stu misses its opportunity to produce converts.

See No Evil 2 (2014) movie review
See No Evil 2 is another instalment to a neglected horror series, it’s a direct sequel to the first movie and takes place immediately following the events of the first movie, it’s written better and has a better cast and premise than the first one. It’s competent for a low budget horror flick, and had Kane not run for public office and be currently serving as Knox County Sheriff I’d look forward to another edition.

The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022): 10-Category Review
The Secrets of Dumbledore is convoluted by inconsequential plotlines and redundant characters. It's so unfocused, it doesn't have a consistent tone or protagonist. The film centers around wizarding politics, but doesn't elaborate on them. This shrinks the Potterverse and satisfies nobody. Meanwhile, Redmayne and Law's protagonist duet is equally unsatisfying. Oddly, no character feels essential (besides Grindelwald) and action sequences don't progress the story. Ultimately, the movie is overstuffed and develops nothing. Mikkelsen and Fogler excel in their limited roles, but they're sparse in this jumble. Without streamlining, The Secrets of Dumbledore is emotionally uninspired.

Technically, The Secrets of Dumbledore is disappointing. First, the effects are overdone. Earlier action is compelling, but the finale is undercut by excessive CGI. Plus, the production design in that final act feels empty. Squandering the union of fantasy and period dressings, the climax is woefully shallow. Furthermore, the editing is bloated and arbitrary because scenes don't influence one another. Lastly, the imagery is drab due to needlessly muted colors and plain framing. The solid music, impressive cast, and meaningful sound can only go so far. Overall, The Secrets of Dumbledore might please some, but is unlikely to leave an impression.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011): 10-Category Review
Skilled yet flawed, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a fitting end to the series. First, the story is comprehensive but incomplete. It's entirely third act, completely consumed by a climactic battle. This is emotionally tiring and thematically cramped. Furthermore, character limitations are exposed. Specifically, Voldemort is a flat villain. After so long, viewers never learned his motivations. Meanwhile, Harry is similarly generic. There isn't much complexity inside his "chosen one" trope. Conversely, Snape's compelling reveal gives him and Dumbledore depth (with performances to match). Yet, while that counters the script's shortcomings, it doesn't erase them.

Likewise, The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is technically good, not great. The cinematography uses Dutch angles and composition, yet fails to utilize focus, color, or symbolism. The editing has powerful smash inserts and memory montages, but is awkwardly paced due to structural issues. The complex sound is occasionally stylish, but lacks thematic implications. However, the music revives John Williams' iconic score, the production is epic once again, and the cast is as elaborate as ever. Plus, the extensive effects are a given. Thus, The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is an above average film that deserves both judgement and recognition.

NOSTALGIA in Matrix: Resurrections and Spider-Man: No Way Home (SPOILER REVIEW)
What is up, nerds? Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to this two for one value review of Matrix: Resurrections and Spider-Man: No Way Home! Because they rely so heavily on Hollywood’s favorite street drug NOSTALGIA and came out within a couple days of each other, I thought it only made sense to comparatively review them, especially since one is a great example of how to handle expectations and fan service and the other is frankly a disappointing failure.

One disclaimer up front: it’s pretty hard to constructively speak about these films unless we delve into spoilers frequently and comprehensively so fair warning here, now let’s get into it!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3ka9uipNw&amp;t=684s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3ka9uipNw&amp;t=684s) \- video review

We’ll start with what is the stinker between the two movies, Resurrections. It’s no surprise that WB decided it was time to harness the power of Keanu’s world overcoming charm and market hotness to revisit one of their most beloved franchises. But the movie never quite shakes the feeling that this is an opportunistic revisiting of the Matrix made while the getting is good and we’ll see that more and more as we go along.

The movie starts out following the life of a suspiciously alive Thomas Anderson who now works for a game company, his greatest creation being a trilogy of games called the Matrix that seems to mirror the real-world film trilogy that we know frame for frame. He can’t quite shake the fact that something feels off in his day to day life though and goes to a blue-eyeglassed psychiatrist to sort out his strange behavioral episodes that he’s gotten in trouble for. There’s an emptiness in him and these episodes provide keyhole glimpses into a life that feels so real. Anderson also runs into an equally unselfaware but curious woman named Tiffany who looks just like Trinity but she’s living a domestic life with a husband and kids. But they have a connection and we as the audience wait with bated breath to discover whether these are the same characters we know and love and if so, how they survived the original trilogy.

This anticipation is all that got me through the first third of the movie. Corny, out of place meta jokes about the Matrix needing to mindfuck its audience, an annoying dudebro type that feels like Greg Miller impression, and more are hard to sit through. Eventually though, new character Bugs of the impractical eyewear and Tiktok hair and her team are here to help Neo “wake the fuck up, samurai,” and during this scene, we are treated to “scenes from Anderson’s game the Matrix” displayed on the walls as meta callbacks to jolt his memory, regain his Oneness, and get this boring movie going.

And once they do, the movie gets going, well, MORE. Bugs is likeable enough and is at least proactive but she’s all the supporting cast help we get. There’s a guy named Morpheus, but he’s really just an AI that approximates Morpheus, as the original has long since died fighting the machines. This new Morpheus AI shows up early on but soon disappears, making his inclusion a marketing red herring. Niobe returns in an unintentionally funny “I’m an old lady” act by Jada Pinkett-Smith. Her motivations are murky as she now enjoys the services of defected machines who help them grow food but seems fairly content to not bother the hostile machine factions that continue to wage war against humans, even going so far as hold Neo prisoner and also not pursue them once Bugs breaks him out to go rescue Trinity from the machine city. **Who knows, maybe she was just counting on Will Smith to go slap somebody around for her.** **Maybe he could use some pent up rage for passing up Neo all those years ago?**

Anyway, the machines defecting is a cool but fanfictiony idea that doesn’t mean anything to the story proper, unless you count how incredibly non-threating the machines are now, but more on that later.

Another returning character that is just not done right is Agent Smith, who is not only now Neo’s boss at the company that makes Matrix games but is also a rogue AI who seems to enjoy keeping Neo alive just so he can kill him later for some reason. His new actor is fine but this guy definitely should’ve just been a new character, as his being Smith just feels completely perfunctory.

As Neo and Trinity slowly wake up and the psychiatrist reveals that he’s a  machine called the Analyst, another cool new idea pops up as the fulcrum on which the story’s conflict hinges. Neo and Trinity were reconstructed after their deaths and now their connection acts as the main energy source which powers the new Matrix system. But because their connection is so strong and allows them to override and manipulate the Matrix, the Analyst has kept them close in their pods in the real world but not too close so they can make a useful connection for the Matrix but not a strong enough one to overtake it. Two things: I like this idea theoretically but it doesn’t jive with the original movies. Neo and Trinity weren’t always that close physically nor did that have anything to do with the strength of their connection when they met in the Matrix. It’s also a logistical nightmare to have these two so close if you anticipate anyone trying to sabotage or rescue these two extremely important people, which is EXACTLY what Bugs and the rest of the resistance eventually do.

Another glaring plot hole is that Bugs and the rest basically just will their way into the machine city and start jacking with Neo and Trinity’s hookups to make them wake up and start resisting the Matrix. They have all the time they need to, just enough to unlock Neo and Trinity’s latent memories and connection through realizing that the Matrix game is actually THEIR REAL MEMORIES. WHOAAA. Good plan, machines, I’m sure constantly reminding them of their exact reality from before would in no way cause them to relapse into autonomous people! Even funnier is that as soon as they escape, the machines show up in droves like where the FUCKKKKK. Really? Where were you all for the last fifteen minutes while they’re inside the Matrix brazenly trying to influence each other against their programming?

Another plot hole is that unless you’re going to argue that the Matrix footage we keep is just the in-universe game’s cinematics, it makes no sense why live action footage is supposed to represent game graphics, especially when Tiffany notes that in-game Trinity looks and acts just like her and it’s weirding her out. Duh shit, lady, you are literally a photographic identical match, a problem of confused identity that would only make sense if the game footage looked like game footage and not just an exact replica. There’s another similar plot hole too from earlier that notes the reason it’s taken Bugs and company so long to find Neo is that while he had the same name of Thomas Anderson as before, the machines had made him look way different to other people so they’ve passed him over. In a world of contrived reality, that’s the excuse you’re giving for 60 YEARS OF FAILED SEARCHING? Good grief.

Anyway, so our heroes break Neo and Trinity out of their mental bondage, they’re back together and ready to jack in and out of each other’s matrix, all is well. So then we get to the final showdown where the machines are really trying to contain these two, in what can only be described as a car chase with pretty awesome car crash effects but with Neo just force pushing zombies or mind-controlled humans over and over. It’s so mid 2000s zombie obsession but it speaks to yet another problem: the Matrix’s story and characters are weak but that’s not because they focused too much on making the fight scenes look good.

Nobody in this film looks comfortable fighting. Maybe it’s their age or the wrong choreographers but the action has gotten worse and worse over the years, losing its grounding in actual martial arts and replacing everything with effects and floaty wire stunts. Here, though, it’s not cynically overwritten by CGI, but it is so slow and telegraphed, it’s hard to take seriously. Only Bugs’s actress, who is a proven martial artist as seen in Iron Fist, seems to be either given or capable of fighting confidently and with some spark. Everyone else is moving in bullet time but not in a good way.

So that brings us to the final leg of the movie and the last major problem: Resurrections has a terrible villain. At first the Analyst AI is murderous and manipulative and cold, but soon we find his bark has no bite, and he sounds like an agitated babysitter that just finds Neo annoying like a baby that spits up too much, not a being of immense power that threatens his rule. The whole movie lacks any real danger as some machines have started to play nice with the resistance and the ones that are supposedly still mining us for energy in the Matrix can’t be bothered to have any security around the two most volatile Matrix members in Neo and Trinity.

And then there’s Neil Patrick Harris’s performance, the true villain of the movie. I bear the guy no ill will, I mean any faults of Barney in How I Met Your Mother were usually those of the writers, and he definitely gave Count Olaf his all, despite him not really being scary enough to be a villain. The same holds true here. At first I thought his sassiness would imply his callous disdain for Neo and humanity but turns out he really is just that dispossessed of any substantive thought or menace. He’s a shitlord, a memey, 2021 slang dropping dweeb who self-aware pauses to land his jokes and side eye the camera. Its so tonally off base I got a little angry watching him, especially in the last scene, which is a trainwreck end to end. Between Neo and Trinity’s terribly unfunny banter, the Analyst taking no steps to stop them, but acting like he just wants them to get off his lawn, to Trinity randomly being able to fly because time’s up, me too and then that egregrious final shot of laughable CGI Neo and Trinity flying away together, I just can’t. What is this movie? Why are there no stakes? How has this once vaunted series succumbed so fully to Resurrectile Dysfunction?

There are no answers and the whole thing just reeks of a skeleton crew doing another day’s work to mine the series for its last dime. In case you were wondering, that particular observation is  even a meta joke in one of the early scenes where Not So Agent Smith tells Tommy Andy that Warners Brothers has asked for a cash grab sequel to their game. Haha, get it? (“why” Tommy boy about paint chips) Why tell the audience you didn’t’ want to do this unless you think you’re so subversive you secretly made a counter corporation film right under their noses or you’re just so guiltless that you’re telling us you don’t care? It operates like a fan film with few good or new ideas and seems to enjoy retconning old plot points for shiggles. It’s not that you can’t watch the movie and get some of enjoyment out of it. Seeing the old folks back together is fun and it’s a pleasant enough looking movie. Resurrections is just simply a movie that didn’t need to be made and often doesn’t feel like it wanted to be made. I’m sad to say, but The Matrix should’ve stayed dead.

Ok, so I killed and reburied Resurrections for you so let’s get to a movie I’m actually really excited to talk about, No Way Home. This is one the most fun and heartfelt Marvel movies we’ve had, which I’ll be honest, isn’t saying a ton about the usual 7.5 to 8 out of 10 Marvel filler movies but I digress. No Way Home’s all about friends looking out for each other and features at least Marvel and Sony, and possibly even Netflix all working together to make sure their respective properties fit together in a cohesive universe and it’s beautiful to see. I can’t say I ever thought I’d see the day. There are some big problems with the narrative but ultimately they can’t overshadow how much fucking fun the fan service is or the sheer joy of the Spider-Man mythos just whipping it out and giving us the business.

Ok, so if you’ll recall, our last Spidey movie had Mysterio using doctored footage to make Spidey look like he killed Mysterio and then proceeded to broadcast his identity across the world. (insert Sonic commercial “and that’s no good!” Whenever that happens, people die? Right? You’d assume that’s where the movie’s going but not quite, at least not yet. Peter, his girlfriend MJ and best bud Ned can’t get into MIT now because of the vigilante double life he’s led. He gets sort of looked at like a weirdo as he walks through high school. I mean hard hitting stuff here. The worst thing that happens is that SHIELD charges him with him with reckless superheroing or something and this prompts an unexpected treat in none other than Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock stepping in as his lawyer. I fucking love that show and it’s so great they kept him in this role and didn’t recast it. But that’s the long and short of the fallout from this extremely bad news: no villains come after him, nothing.

Peter then visits Dr. Strange, hot off his using the time stone to defeat Thanos, promptly buggering up the timeline as evidenced by Wandavision and Loki’s recent seasons (so I’ve read, I’ve not seen them yet). Peter’s like “bro, can you go back in time and unboink my life? It’s hurting my friends” which is sweet, but God’s sakes, we just messed up the timeline doing this. Dr. Strange promptly says NO. And then he says YES, I won’t undo time but I’ll make everyone forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Which is BONKERS to me. Then to top off the ridiculosity of this scene, Strange starts doing this spell and Peter keeps interrupting the incantation with indecisive modifications so that only the people whom he loves can remember, like Aunt May, Happy, MJ, and Ned. This messes up the spell and causes Strange to cancel it  and contain what he’s already cast in a magic box. Unfortunately, the spell has half worked so it’s pulled some people into their plane that know Peter’s alter ego. Why the spell physically retrieves people to wipe their memory makes no sense whatsoever so chalk that up as crazy story point numero dos. Peter first runs into Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock, who’s great fun, and then Willem Dafoe in an awesome turn. These guys act like they never stopped playing the characters, stepping right out of the early 2000s without missing a beat. We even run into the Lizard, Electro, and Sandman, all played by their original actors. They’re written with less care but their inclusion is still welcome. We learn that all these villains have been pulled back from the brink of their own imminent deaths and so they agree to play nice with our heroes as being sent back to their timelines means they will die.

This juncture is where we encounter our second or even third plot contrivance: instead of sending all these badguys back, Peter decides with the sentimental advice of his outreach loving Aunt May that we first need to try and cure all these mentally ill people. The problem with this bleeding heart idea is that these aren’t just lions with thorns in their paws, these are all murderers and to suggest otherwise is idealistic to the point of intentional naivete. How does Aunt May even know they can be cured, much less at a moment’s notice? Regardless, Peter and friends decide to do just that. And by friends I don’t just mean MJ and Ned, I’m talking no-holds barred, legit versions of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield’s Spideys. Turns out not only villains came through into Tom Holland’s world, but all the other Peter Parkers who of course also technically know Peter is Spider-Man. Brilliant! The time has come for rejoicing; they’re really in the movie and they’re great! It’s wonderful to see Sony and Marvel working together to make this happen and the interplay between is very funny and nostalgic and creative in getting them to learn from each other. This move is also genius because it legitimizes any and all movies as being part of the multiverse, not disconnected false starts. The only aspect of this reveal that isn’t great is how incredibly nonchalant Garfield and Maguire’s Spideys are that they just been stolen from their dimension. It’s a really weird oversight but I guess they figured we wouldn’t care much so they didn’t bother to make this more realistic. Regardless, Maguire’s wisened Spidey is cool to see here and he has some great acting moments without even saying a word and Garfield steals the show with his comedic timing and a heartwarming callback we’ll get to soon.

Ok, so we have our villains and heroes assembled and the Spideys are using their scientific knowledge to manufacture cures for the villains. Again, this is so MacGuffiney and preposterously easy that it begs the question why it was never tried before, not to mention it will definitely affect other people’s timelines in ways we’ve been told not to do but….this decision does not come without consequences. The Green Goblin is struggling with his split personality and unfortunately the bad side wins out and he convinces the other villains to break the tenuous peace they’ve brokered, the villains escape, and Aunt May is fatally injured.

This scene crushed me, mostly because I recalled Aunt May’s passing naturally in the comics and how much that reminded me of my own grandmother’s passing as well. The cynical side of me hates this twist as it was all brought on by an improbable and sentimental course of action taken to correct what was a rather silly, unnecessarily messy magic spell but yknow, the scene still hits you hard. And when she delivers Uncle Ben’s line about great power and responsibility, it feels a little tone deaf but where this scene takes Holland Spidey is mature and well meaning.

Holland goes mental, brutally fighting the Goblin, and it feels a lot like the intense Raimi fights from the old Spidey movies. The Goblin gets away and Holland vows to kill him, a darker path than I could’ve imagined and a welcome one. The Spideys reconvene and decide to lure the villains to the remote Statue of Liberty for the final showdown. Once the villains bite and show up, they get handled by the Spideys working together. The battle’s exciting enough to watch but Garfield steals the show yet again. When MJ is knocked off the Statue of Liberty, Garfield dives over and rescues her, a beautiful redemptive moment that’ll have the audience in as many tears as Garfield as we recall the tragedy of Gwen Stacy’s death. But there’s one last great moment, and it all comes down to the Goblin. Holland is out to kill him for the death of Aunt May and once he gains the upper hand, it’s only Maguire that can stare him down, like “you don’t want to do this.” It’s brilliant wordless acting, and it works because we’ve experienced the same rage and sadness at her death as Holland’s Peter has. Holland has grown up and we’ve gotten to see a darker, more rewarding character arc than any of his previous movies or really the Marvel Cinematic Universe in general outside of Iron Man.

And that’s how you do nostalgia and fan service. It’s magical to see what we had dreamed was possible—all three Spider-Men—working together to stop all the original villains together. It’s great to see all their stories ratified as canon, not to mention this movie appears to have garnered enough fan support to give both Garfield and Maguire at least one more film each, a totally unexpected but wonderful turn of events. Giving Holland a wide range of emotions and a melancholy ending where he’s alone but his friends are safe just feels right, like we’ve grown and watched something more profound than the average super yarn. But based on the cookie scene, there might be a black symbiote lurking in the wings to take Peter to a truly dark place again. Who knows?

Ok, fam, that’s my review of two late 2021 movies that bank on nostalgia. Resurrections doesn’t work despite its efforts to make us feel anything more than loathing that it’s not building on the trilogy before it, but cannibalizing it for parts, to mix my turns of phrase. No Way Home is certainly a little contrived in how it gets characters where it wants them to go, but like my old film teacher used to say, if people care about the characters and the story in your movie, they will excuse almost anything else. No Way Home is exciting, heartfelt, and absolutely worth your time if you’re obsessed with the comics or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That’s all for now so thank you for watching and may your 2022 absolutely slap! See you next time!

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007): 10-Category Review
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is everything we've come to expect. It's well-rounded because the story, acting, and filmmaking are all established. The script contains flaws, but stays true to the immensely popular book. Specifically, it's overstuffed and tonally inconsistent, but that can happen when adapting a large novel. It still follows the beloved characters, it deals with fresh conflicts, and it has serious loss. Plus, we get new dynamic characters and a new key location, deepening the universe. Furthermore, this material is elevated by the excellent cast because they have all gotten comfortable in their roles.

Meanwhile, the technicals of Order of the Phoenix are tried and true. The music is noticeably not John Williams, but remains appropriately mystical and elegant. The sound is rich with spell action and atmospheric ambience. The visuals are surprisingly symbolic, and the effects are expectedly complex. Together, they produce the best action sequence in the series. Lastly, the production design is the core of the Harry Potter film series because it creates an elaborate and cohesive world. It may not be pristine art, but it's generally enjoyable entertainment. Overall, Order of the Phoenix is another steady step in the Potterverse.

Sonic the Hedgehog (2020): 10-Category Review
Sonic the Hedgehog is generic. The script haphazardly tosses Sonic's eccentric reality into a trite family film, without harmonizing the genres. Aimlessly alternating between Sonic action and stale buddy adventures, Sonic the Hedgehog provides nothing new or genuine. In fact, the story is so lifeless, Marsden visibly struggles through earlier scenes. His chemistry with Schwartz eventually develops, but even when the plot moves, it's emotionally empty. Ultimately, Sonic the Hedgehog is an overextended commercial. Carrey and Schwartz are playful, but this story is a franchise leech. Because there's no insight, drama, surprise, or creativity, Sonic the Hedgehog is bland.

Meanwhile, Sonic the Hedgehog's filmmaking is equally forgettable. The sound is solid (with whizzing and mechanics) and the cast is fairly recognizable. There's a crafty shot or two, a fun Carrey dance number, decent CGI (but poor green screening), and an efficient runtime. Yet, those are outliers. The cinematography, music, effects, and editing are largely unimpressive. Generally, the experience is presented plainly, without craft. Plus, the production design clashes and possesses excessive product placements. Furthermore, the mood is flat, never daring to get uncomfortable. Overall, Sonic the Hedgehog isn't too painful, but it's completely dull and predictable.

Transformers (2007): 10-Category Review
Transformers is a loud mess. It sparked a lucrative franchise, but the film is shallow and cluttered. First, the script is nonsense. Clearly, the writers had predetermined goals and forced a narrative around them. The vague MacGuffin, unreliable plot points, and muddled storylines only serve mindless action and cheap emotional manipulations. Besides the battles, there isn't anything here. Shia LaBeouf's charisma elevates his character, but even then, it's difficult for viewers to care. Ultimately, Transformers is a means to an end. Its sole purpose is to provide robots crashing into buildings, and that's about as empty as movies get.

Meanwhile, Transformers is technically inconsistent. The significant (and occasionally practical) effects are a positive. The sound gets symbolic and the cinematography gets dramatic, but both are also chaotic and disorienting. Furthermore, during the finale, timing and spacing dissolve because the editing is incoherent. It's hard to know what's going on, where characters are, and how to feel. Plus, the soundtrack is forced, the production design is flooded with product placements, and the tone is erratic. Together, these aspects are distracting rather than immersive. Overall, some may like Transformers for its pointless excitement, but many will find it annoying.

Big Trouble (2002) movie review
Big Trouble is a quirky comedy film that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome, with a star studded cast, this is a before they were famous films. My interest was peaked originally because Rene Russo and Dennis Farina star, they worked alongside each other in Get Shorty, and Barry Sonnenfeld directed Get Shorty. Big Trouble centres around a Nuclear bomb in a briefcase, with an entire cast full of idiots but it does ok, and has some neat set pieces.

Does anyone actually use a "critics" review to decide to watch a movie ?
I am curious how many real everyday people use critics to decide to watch a movie vs. audience score or third option there own minds. If not aren't they useless to everyone who is not a movie snob and if so why are they "given" so much credit. In a way are they not basically an influencer in today's world and have no real authority other than what they conceive in there own minds on movies or given to them by websites and magazines?

Armageddon (1998): 10-Category Review
Armageddon is simultaneously enjoyable and obnoxious. First, the plot is basic and nonsensical. It's a fun premise but requires excessive suspensions of disbelief. Also, the characters and dialogue are lowbrow. Entire scenes exist solely for immature jokes. Most of the broad strokes work (especially the bittersweet ending), but the details are clumsy and contrived. For example, it's nice that Armageddon has an emotional core, but that conflicted romance is shallow. Furthermore, once the space adventure begins, the movie gets into a repetitive loop of exhausting crises. Ultimately, the writing got the big picture right, but was erratically executed.

Conversely, the technicals save Armageddon. The imagery gets unpleasant in space, but is primarily cinematic. Its sweeping camerawork and stylized lighting energize the drama. The sound and editing are overdone, but they tackle complex montages and action sequences. The production design is disappointing on the asteroid, yet still elaborate. The significant effects include real explosions. The soundtrack has some good jukebox tunes and an iconic anthem. Plus, the cast is impressive, especially in hindsight. Overall, Armageddon has cheap emotions but sturdy craft, making it surprisingly fair entertainment. It isn't deep and it gets chaotic, but Armageddon is fun.

Swiss Army Man (2016): 10-Category Review
Swiss Army Man is a treasure. Combining strangeness with relatability, whimsicalness with substance, and silliness with thoughtfulness, it unites everything into a visionary experience. Thus, Swiss Army Man challenges conventional formulas and is a whirlwind of fresh air. Its story follows a stranded, suicidal man, interrupted by a corpse washed ashore. Inspired, he takes the corpse and journeys home. Along the way, they build a friendship as the corpse begins talking and helping out. It's never explained if this is imagined, but each interpretation comes with themes of authenticity and courage. Plus, the performances from Dano and Radcliffe are touching and fascinating. 

Meanwhile, Swiss Army Man's technicals are skillfully unique, yet powerfully supportive. Visually, the lighting, colors, framing, and movement create a lighthearted atmosphere while conveying messages. The cartoonish sound is surprisingly rich, the production design turns trash into art, and the exaggerated effects contribute to the playful tone. Also, the acapella soundtrack elevates the mood and suggests a vulnerable connection between the characters. Furthermore, the editing is explosive, driving the film with smash cuts and symbolic inserts. Finally, the direction is a triumph, realizing its vision and transforming its mediums into a masterpiece. Undoubtedly, Swiss Army Man is special.

Cruella (2021): 10-Category Review
Cruella has solid style with passable substance. The narrative is clunky, working towards predetermined marks rather than a natural story. Character motivations are inconsistent, plot points are convoluted, and themes are muddled. The writing isn't a total mess because Cruella's split personality is interesting and the script has adequate structure, but its shallow qualities are difficult to digest. Still, the acting of Emma Stone carries the experience and gives viewers an emotional connection. Stone revels in her duel personas, finding an enjoyable level of campiness. Truly, without Stone's skills, Cruella's drama would feel completely empty. Luckily, she holds it all together.

Meanwhile, the technicals of Cruella are pretty good. The camerawork is active, using extended shots, movement, and framing to create engagement. The editing capitalizes on montages, the sound punctuates chapter conclusions, and the effects add artistic touches (despite excessive CGI). The jukebox soundtrack is overdone, but generally serves the atmosphere. Plus, the elaborate production design establishes the era, yet also finds a unique look. Overall, Cruella has some quality craft, making it a decent movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a cohesive vision to transform those pieces into something more. Therefore, Cruella overcomes its shortcomings, but doesn't erase them.

CODA (2021): 10-Category Review
CODA is progress. The plot is formulaic, but it portrays an underrepresented community. Depicting complex deaf characters with legitimately deaf actors, CODA deserves recognition. Plus, the story has real obstacles, effective arcs, and touching conversations. Its convenient conclusion slightly undermines its conflicts, but the catharsis still feels earned. Ultimately, CODA displays atypical life in a world built for typical abilities, a poignant message. Furthermore, the acting elevates the material. Jones is wholly relatable, Derbez is eccentrically heartfelt, and Matlin, Kotsur, and Durant communicate various waves of nonverbal emotion. Thus, the script's shortcomings are outweighed by its dramatic impact.

Meanwhile, CODA's filmmaking is above average. The cinematography uses attractive framing to convey significance, the editing utilizes intercutting during the climax, and the production design sets a humble tone. The soundtrack is an integral part of the narrative, heightening emotions and creating a nostalgic mood. Also, the sound design uses symbolic silence to show how deaf people can feel disconnected from the hearing community. Therefore, CODA might not be a technical masterclass, but it remains powerful for its meaningful use of relevant mediums. It isn't a perfect film, but CODA is clearly a valuable experience.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)
My co-host and I have a podcast in which we dissect traditional notions of "the canon" by reviewing all of the movies, music, and books that we're "supposed" to know but never made time for.

In our most recent episode, we reviewed George Roy Hill's *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*. Neither of us are huge fans of Westerns, but we are both definitely fans of William Goldman, so we were interested to see where we would wind up after watching. On one hand, Paul Newman and Robert Redford are very charming. On the other hand, they may actually be *too* charming.

Give us a listen on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-the-velvet-underground/id1605925377?i=1000554876234), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3RHnoFPCmBQKV6hAHZb9qZ?si=X9NsRst1TIC6EF09wXx44A), or wherever you catch your pods.

Face/Off (1997): 10-Category Review
Face/Off is shameless entertainment. The story of rivals switching faces is a ridiculous yet captivating premise. Shrewdly, Face/Off pushes past the science to the thrills. Once audiences do the same, they'll enjoy the ride. Like most cheesy action movies, the story is less about practicality and more about opening fun doors. Face/Off exemplifies this because its role reversals are compelling and novel. Plus, seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta switch personas halfway through the film is interesting. Neither character is deep, but they're different enough for an engaging gimmick. Furthermore, there's plenty of gratuitous action to make the film worthwhile.

Technically, Face/Off is good. The cinematography is superficial, yet active and clear. The editing has awkwardness and pacing issues, but maintains energetic and coherent action. The sound is complex and emotional. The soundtrack is dated, but has a reoccurring melody that shifts tones. Also, the effects deserve credit for extreme 90s explosions and stunts. That tangible action is sorely missed today. Lastly, the casting of Cage and Travolta makes the movie. Face/Off probably wouldn't have its enduring following if not for such notable leads. Therefore, while Face/Off is clearly a cheesy flick, it accomplishes its goals well.

Old Henry (2021) movie review
It’s a rather late night and I began watching Old Henry after I mistook Tim Blake Nelson for Jackie Earl Harley on the poster, both are terrific actors but I hadn’t seen Harley in a role for a a few years and as of this writing I still haven’t. Old Henry is a really well put together western and the script is subtle and well written, it’s arguably a testament to how much content is available with so many streaming services to choose from. There’s a lot of content both good and bad to miss out on and Old Henry is the former.

The Outfit (2022): 10-Category Review
In the franchise era, The Outfit is refreshing for its contained story. Also, its bottled nature amplifies details and thrills, building tension through shifting characters. Everyone has a secret and every conversation has ulterior motives. Each scene is unpredictable and it's unclear who viewers can trust, making The Outfit thoroughly captivating. The narrative gets improbable and the ending is convenient, but overall, the writing deserves credit for weaving efficient conflicts. Furthermore, the acting (especially Deutch and Rylance) is deceptively layered, igniting the script's strengths and softening its flaws. Therefore, despite The Outfit's plot holes, it's highly riveting.

Meanwhile, The Outfit's craft maintains excitement. Bottle movies depend on filmmaking for entertainment weight, and The Outfit delivers. Particularly, the editing keeps tensions high and the runtime concise. Plus, the timeline manipulations are flavorful and symbolic. Next, the music accents the era, the sound is dramatic, and the direction provides a consistent tone. Lastly, the cinematography utilizes lighting and composition, the production is immersive, and the effects meet the material. These aspects aren't elaborate, but they're meaningful. Ultimately, The Outfit is balanced, with key performances and a tight script. It's not a blockbuster, but it's firmly enjoyable.

See No Evil (2006) movie review
See No Evil is one of WWE’s first attempts straying into the movie business, it somehow received a sequel and starred Kane as Jacob Goodnight. Along with The Condemned and The Marine it was a strong start for a fledgling movie studio, but like most projects taking place outside of pro wrestling, when push comes to shove and it requires real money WWE comes up short. See No Evil had a small budget and a limited release but by all means made money.

Choose or Die review
Man, this movie was a real heartbreak for me. Saw the trailer on YouTube and was so excited for the premiere date on Netflix. Watched it on day one. Sadly, Netflix really dropped the ball with this one. Started off with a great idea/premise, a gruesome baby of Saw meets Oregon Trail. Then, somewhere in the middle, the film falls off a cliff of messy storytelling and boring scenes. The final battle was pretty cool conceptually though. The final scenes try to tie everything together, but it just falls flat. Somewhere after the beginning, the film loses its edge and any scariness it has. A great concept lost in terrible execution. Combine that with a wasted cameo by horror icon Robert Englund and this film is not only a Netflix dud but a crime against horror films.

Sherlock Holmes (2009) movie review
Sherlock Holmes is an interesting adaption of the Conan Doyle books, partly because it’s adapted in pursuit of action rather than mystery. I’ve not read any of the Sherlock Holmes books, but as most adaptions focus more on the investigative practices rather than a fast paced action filled environment, I’m assuming the action is a small part of the books. Regardless, I found Guy Ritchie’s film to enjoyable and well produced.

Changing Lanes (2002) movie review
It’s a brand new week for my anniversary reviews, and it’s a good week in wide releases, every movie was generally well received or made back their budget. Apart from The Cat’s Meow, they’re all original screenplays though that’s based on a book, I plan to review everything apart from The Sweetest Thing. Changing Lanes is a movie that stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, and they’re terrific in this movie. Roger Michell directed this movie, and sadly recently passed away, Michell left the world on a high note but unfortunately couldn’t bathe in the success of The Duke which recently released in cinemas, Changing Lanes wouldn’t be on the movies he’s most well known for, but it’s worth a watch.

The Adjustment Bureau (2011) movie review
This is a neat film that I’m shocked hasn’t squeezed out a bad sequel or remade into a television series for a streaming service. Matt Damon plays a politician in this movie, I watched this when it first came out on Sky movies all those years ago and it holds up. Mainly because they spend time developing the characters, the adjustments are more of a backdrop to the relationship as opposed to being the only interesting idea in the movie. The movie is based off a Philip K. Dick novel, it shouldn’t surprise me that it’s such a well ironed out idea as Dick has inspired and produced a long list of science fiction novels and could be considered one of the best storytellers of modern fiction.

The King’s Man
Watching The King’s Man was like watching a hockey game, sure you’ll watch it, but the whole time you’re really just hoping to see a fight. And that is precisely what this movie was missing, more action!

If I wanted to see Ralph Fiennes in a drama, I’d watch The English Patient, and I already did that in high school (to avoid reading the book).

I will say that I appreciated learning the history of The Kingsmen organization that this origin story offered, such as why they’re all named after King Arthur’s knights or why it exists, but at 2 hours and 11 mins, I definitely felt like they took the scenic route.

In conclusion, don’t expect the over-the-top action sequences that you remember from the first two films and second, before you return the book The English Patient, at least bend the spine several times and dog-ear a few pages otherwise Mr. Gomez will know you watched the movie and didn’t read the book.

✈️ = Watch only if on a plane and there are no other options

I have been a passing fan of Don Marquis' "Archy &amp; Mehitabel" humorous newspaper columns (that date from 1916) for quite a while. Their conceit was that of copy written by a cockroach in office off-hours, relaying his poetic take on life and events in Bohemian New York City, including his fraught relationship with Mehitabel, a sensation-loving female alley-cat. I was surprised to discover there was an animated musical film made from these stories (an adaptation of a Broadway musical from 1957) and that the film was available on Youtube (in two different edits!). The different edits rearrange some segments (the film is essentially episodic anyway), extend others and occasionally utilize some different animation (favoring George Herriman's original newspaper illustrations, which also means we get cameos from Krazy Kat &amp; Ignatz!). Would that Tim Lucas' wonderful **VIDEO WATCHDOG MAGAZINE** was still running, to favor us all with a thorough review of the variances!

**SHINBONE ALLEY** tells the "origin" of cockroach Archy (Eddie Bracken), here imagined as a depressed suicidal poet who emerges from his death plunge into the New York harbor transformed into a bug (seemingly, though, already known by other bugs and back alley denizens). He's driven to compose essays about his fellow depression-era denizens ("The Firefly," "The Moth") as well as addressing his infatuation with Mehitabel, a cat of loose morals who embodies the joie de vivre spirit of lower class Bohemian life. The story tracks the ups and downs of this friction-fraught relationship (Mehitabel is eternally attracted to the wrong kind of Tomcat, Archy can be a moralizing pill \[bug\] at times) - it's kind of a Pinocchio/Jiminy Cricket dynamic.

There's a lot to like about **SHINBONE ALLEY**, in all of its pre-Ralph Bakshi-styled oddness. But we must address the elephant in the room first - the film's weakest element is its songs (a potential kiss-of-death for a musical) which, with a few exceptions ("Flotsam &amp; Jetsam On The Sea Of Life", "Dance, Mehitabel, Dance" and the harmonizing on "Pretty Kitty") just aren't very good, most seeming tuneless when they should be memorable, catchy &amp; witty. As evidenced by my review of **MR. ROSSI SEARCHES FOR HAPPINESS**, I'm a fan of these off-brand animated offerings - a cartoon musical from 1970, adapting a stage musical from 1957 that itself was adapting humorous newspaper columns from the early 20th Century is certainly an odd enough artifact to catch my attention, and this film could be seen as a grungier version of Disney's **THE ARISTOCATS** (also 1970) or a less-Beat **TOP CAT (1961)**. What's interesting is that the producers seem to have realized that the hedonistic 1960s youth culture had a natural overlap with the Bohemian-era 1920s, so you get a "dirty old, Depression New York" setting for pieces suffused with animated psychedelic imagery or thematic, counter-cultural resonance (Mehitabel obviously believes in free love and the "Moth" segment has definite pre-echoes of the inherent dangers in drug/sensation/addiction culture).

The main sequences and character designs are done in a cheap, loose, scratchy style (with expressionistic backgrounds) which, as previously noted, sometime revert to their Herriman originals while the psychedelic sequences utilize repetition, color and photo collage. There are sly Beat and Hippie references as well (a goate-ed, bongo playing Hispanic spider who responds to the statement "Civilization is going to pot!" with "Viva la Pot!" or Mehitabel's female friends who, after a gag involving a garbage can, claim that she's the "only cat I know who can take a trip like that on a lid"). Mehitabel (originally played on Broadway by Eartha Kitt, here enthusiastically voiced by Carol Channing) is the eternally optimistic free spirit and party girl (who's "been through the mill"), at turns impulsive, carefree, irresponsible and narcissistic (she purrs "I'll go slip into something deplorable" at one point and after giving birth to kittens following a fling with the Alan Reed-voiced tomcat Big Bill, she actually considers neglecting them to death!). Channing relishes the role - her recitation of "Beat Shakespeare" when she falls under the Svengali-like influence of disreputable theater-cat Tyrone T. Tattersall (John Carradine) is a hoot! While she appreciates Archy ("Every time I'm all alone, you're here" she observes), his moral scolding eventually drives her to take a "respectable position" as the pet of a rich family (for her newborn kitten's sake)... but it doesn't last.

Not being a Disney film, **SHINBONE ALLEY** can indulge in its own moral quirks a bit, like unplanned pregnancy, alcohol abuse, a brothel of ladybugs, an insect revolution (postponed due to romance), occasional swearing ("To hell with it! To hell with her!") and a sombre, melancholic patch involving Archy (a character for whom suicide looms very large). Even Mehitabel acknowledges the transience of life - "Someday \[my\] guts will string a violin..." In fact, Archy is the soul of the narrative as Mehitabel may never fully change/learn her lesson (her final dance number is quite life-affirming) but Archy eventually realizes that it is her joie de vivre with which he is infatuated, and which allows his poetic heart to find meaning in life. This film is quite a nice little discovery.

Bring BACK Pop-Punk/Emo Movie Soundtracks PLEEEAASSEE
 Can anyone else relate to missing when pop-punk soundtracks used to be in just about EVERY MOVIE throughout the 2000s? (Ok it was mostly just teen comedies tbh but still!) Anyone else have that strong nostalgia for this stuff?   
Like you knew you were watching something special when bands like Blink 182, Simple Plan and Sum 41 kept making features lol.   And with all the media I had around growing up I was destined to fall in love with the genre after watching stuff like American Pie and loving the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series - Pop Punk/emo and all that stuff was always a strong presence and it influenced my taste for the rest of my life!  
 So I wanted to make a bit of a celebration video where I reminisce about that genre and all of its major appearances throughout film. And if that sounds interesting to you as niche as that may be you can check it all out here: [https://youtu.be/VI0cKG2DWHM](https://youtu.be/VI0cKG2DWHM?fbclid=IwAR2wiXfWsdFDKbgBCgN9mqq7VvmFH0JxnQ-eKhlZ9cAndq1sZIZl5WKfAuw)

The Lord of the Rings (1978) movie review
This is an interesting adaption, that proved to be financially successful in 1978, and unfortunately didn’t receive a sequel. It covers the first two books, the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, so the story winds up incomplete. Animated with the help of rotoscope, and a cast of stunt doubles, these techniques help to add a live-action element. The animation is unlike anything you’ve seen, it’s unnervingly fluid for an animated movie. It’s very close to the books, with a few details omitted or changed to maintain a flow of the main story. There’s a lot of information that only seeks to overwhelm anyone who watches, and who’re unfamiliar with the books or other live adaptions.

Movies not allowing screenshots
I have a blog for movie reviews and would use Netflix, Amazon prime or rent videos on Youtube and take screenshots for my blog using my laptop. Today when I tried on all three of those platforms, the screenshot was solid black where the movie image should have been. I can screenshot from the trailers, but not from the rest of the movie. 
Anyone what notice this change? It's not my computer because I can screenshot other stuff fine. They updated their privacy rules or something? So frustrating as I can't always find the exact image I am looking for and so I would take screenshots all the time!

The Bubble (2022): 10-Category Review
The Bubble is low-effort. Apatow is known for structureless comedy, but this is downright lazy. Set during the pandemic, the story aimlessly follows a fictional movie production, loosely building around the conflicts among its mistreated cast. Characters don't arc because they are flat tropes. There isn't a clear protagonist because everyone is unlikable and dispensable. Also, the script doesn't say anything. Ideas surrounding the pandemic, elitism, and workplace toxicity are introduced, but never examined. In fact, the flippant writing actually trivializes those topics. The actors do alright with the empty material, but The Bubble produces more groans than laughs.

Technically, The Bubble is more professional but still lifeless. The sound and music aren't detriments, yet they're never impactful. The cinematography is basic and uninspired. The effects are occasionally tacky (particularly the deep fake faces). The arbitrary editing relies heavily on filler montages (including one during the anticlimactic ending). Plus, the limited production design is cheap. Overall, the direction deserves blame because The Bubble is even less than its meager parts. The cast is interesting and the technicals are tolerable, but the product is a sloppy mess. Without substance, structure, or real humor, The Bubble is a complete misfire.

Boon (2022) movie review
This is a sequel to Red Stone, a movie I reviewed a couple of months ago. Neal McDonough makes his way towards a first writing credit for Boon, as McDonough appears to take a great interest in his work, it peeked my interest for any additional characteristics he could add, but there’s no noticeable differences. Tommy Flannagan also appears, you might remember him from Gladiator and Braveheart, but I recently watched him in an awful comedy called All About the Benjamins.

Elysium (2013) movie review
When I reviewed Panic Room, I gave this film a mention as Jodie Foster stars in both, when it was initially released this felt like hot garbage, it’s slightly better once you get over the first twenty minutes. This is mostly because it hits you over the head with various political themes, mainly health care, social class issues, overpopulation, police brutality, workers rights etc, climate change is the only one it doesn’t explicitly mention, but it’s a feature. There are likely worse examples of movies that do this, but this feels like a lame attempt to get recognition from the Academy.

Venom (2018): 10-Category Review
Venom is mediocre. It's not very good because it provides the bare minimum: hollow character development, motivation, creativity, and logic. Really, Venom is just a collection of popular superhero movie tropes. It's an origin story where the protagonist hardly arcs. Its villain is cartoonishly evil with no depth. The stakes are contrived and the subtext is nonexistent. Still, because Venom has fun with its basic formulas, it avoids becoming a complete mess. It's generic, but playful. In particular, Tom Hardy saves the sparse material with skill and charisma. Overall, it's mindless, but at least Venom isn't painfully dull or bloated.

Meanwhile, Venom possesses some craft. There is an interesting scene transition, a handful of appealing shots, and the effects include some real stunts. Also, the design of Venom's voice is compelling. The final action scene is cluttered, but thankfully, isn't overindulgent. The music is forgettable and the production design is sterile, but at least they are competent. Lastly, the direction lacks an artistic voice, yet mostly remains efficient. The best thing about Venom is that it keeps moving. The build-up to Venom's reveal is decently paced and the filler isn't overbearing. Ultimately, Venom's inferiority is softened by its levity.

What went wrong with Morbius?
My friend and I watched Morbius last night and ...it wasn't good. No character development, rushed relationships, cheesy CGI, questionable acting, nonsensical storylines...so many things went wrong here that we had to make an autopsy video explaining what went wrong with this train wreck.

Curious to know what you think was the main reason this movie failed.
