My Joker movie review
So I went to see the “movie of the year” yesterday. I went at 12:05, sat through some previews saw Star Wars Episode IX, Birds of Prey and other fun trailers. I always go to the movies early so I can see these. I can’t wait for Star Wars and that trailer got me hyped up for that galaxy far, far, away...but then the actual feature began. 

During that 2hr and 2 min long movie, that excitement became a suspenseful feeling. I watched with suspense, amusement, horror, and some reflection. This movie was incredible. Truly a definite piece in Joaquin Phoenix’s career. This movie has caused many walkouts, and has received a good amount of hatred for being too dark, grotesque, or for glorifying violence. Here’s what I saw, I saw a man in this movie living with an illness. This illness slowly consumes him. This movie touches the dark areas of mental health that people who haven’t been there dare not venture down. I admit, I’ve been there. I have had everything go wrong that possibly could and have lost myself in that process, same as Arthur does. 

There is A line in this movie that says “the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don’t” really strikes a nerve with me as it does with countless others. As someone who works in the medical field, it has always been “uncool” to talk about your feelings, what you think, or how something affects you. If you think that still, this movie isn’t for you. But for those of us, who have been on the dark road, who see no end in sight, go see this movie. Go sit, eat your popcorn, drink your soda and enjoy this work of art. Watch the tragedy of Arthur Fleck and then look at your own life, it’s truly an enlightening experience. Joker is a cinematic masterpiece, for those who understand its significance.

“What a fuckin’ film” Film Review: 1917
[Read it on my website here.](https://onesixtyreviews.com/2019/12/18/film-review-1917/)

What a fuckin’ film.

1917 completely blew me away. An absolute thrill ride of a movie, both tense and emotional. Recent film discourse has spoken of certain films not being cinema but rather “theme park rides”. In the best possible way 1917 felt like this. Not to its detriment and not in any way that would mean it’s not cinema. I was completely drawn in and wilfully dragged along for one hell of a ride.

The film is a WW1 drama that’s a simple narrative about getting from point A to point B. It’s shot to appear as one 2 hour long take. This gimmick (wrong word but it is a major selling point) is what really adds to the experience of this film. Although you can see the joins between scenes your ever presence in this world just builds into this insane intensity. Your in real time with the characters and completely invested in their mission.

The film is reminiscent of films like Gravity (2013) and Avatar (2009). Movies that are these huge spectacles where going to see them is an experience. 1917 is honestly the perfect advertisement for the necessity of cinema. Though I will be buying this on UHD sometime next year, watching this film on my couch is will not be the same as having seen it at the movies. If this had come out on a streaming service or made as a limited series the whole feeling that it evokes probably would be undermined.

Director Sam Mendes has crafted a small story on a large scale. The simplicity of the story and its singular focus allow it to be about so much more. You see the horrors of war, the toll it takes on those who fight it and the impact it has on the world it’s fought on. The film is based on stories told to Mendes by his Grandfather Alfred and this grounding in truth is such a strong component of this film.

If Roger Deakins doesn’t win a Oscar for this movies cinematography then there is truly no justice in the world. Hopefully every award is, lovingly, thrown at Deakins. This film is a true marvel. A technical achievement that deserves acknowledgement. The way it’s shot is something to behold and it’s a big reason why this film works so well. Without the combined efforts of both story and technical precision the movie would fall apart, so Deakins’ work is intrinsically important.

The two main leads in Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are as great as you could ever hope for. They sell the situation, sell the fear and sell the courage. They were completely believable as these two young men in that hell of a war. The supporting cast in Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch are also wholly wonderful. The decision to cast bigger names in these smaller roles was a smart idea. The actors added weight to scenes and characters that otherwise wouldn’t have felt the same. Amongst the chaos they added grounding and something for the audience to hold onto.

I can’t speak more highly of this film. I loved it. The film resonated with me on a personal level and my predisposition to enjoy war films probably helped as well. But judge for yourself. I’d be shocked if you didn’t find something in this film that spoke to you.

I’ll begin as a I started…

What a fuckin’ film:

★★★★★

Saw Retrospective: The Series is Very Well Done and Doesn't Get Enough Credit!
Hey-yo, are you a fan of the Saw films? I feel like they're looked down upon for being dumb or too violent but personally I think that they're really underrated. The first couple aren't THAT violent either and focus way more on the mystery element and play out more like a thriller than a horror, and the further sequels get super wrapped up in plot - Yes the traps become the centrepieces but I don't think the films overall get enough credit for everything else that's going on around them. They're mostly really well crafted investigative type movies that somehow keep surprising you freakin' 7 sequels in! Clearly I wasn't the only one that enjoyed them judging off the crazy amounts of money they made throughout the 2000s but even still I believe they're hugely underrated. Now, I'm not saying you can't pick them apart in certain ways and they're definitely a bit silly and trashy too - but I think they're well written enough to justify their existence and I enjoy every single one of them. The original is the best, saw is the worst and all the others are... Pretty great. 

Anyone else have favourites? Or do you just hate them all? (And if so why? Because there's two sides to that I think: there's the people who think they're too violent and don't know much about them. And there's the people who look down upon them as being stupid and convoluted, which in some ways is fair criticism I won't lie hahaha) 

Anyway so also I've made this video essay which is gonna be the first of 3 parts covering the Saw series leading up to Spiral. I've ran out of time though for them to all come out before the new film lol, but I'm glad I got the first part up atleast! I'm sooooo keen for Spiral, got my tickets booked for Wednesday night's preview screening!!!!

Why Jungle Cruise Sucks
Jungle Cruise is the Most Uninspired Movie of the Year

Why it sucks
1- Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is playing a version of himself that fails to impress on every level. The writing, the failing performance, and none of the hammy excellence that makes him the best part of the Fast Franchise all combine to make a character with as much sophistication as a WWE wrestler from 1998 smashing his head into a wall. His character is so lifeless and forgettable that starting at paint dry would have a more engaging character arc.
2- Indiana Jones Lite
For my audience alive for Indians Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, be grateful. You have basically watched this movie already! Imagine a world where Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones had a baby, but it was lacking a heart and soul. Now, stop imagining it because thanks to Disney, you live in this thankless world. If you thought 2021 was bad, the best summary of the year is the depressing dumpster fire that is this movie.
3- The Plot
I solved the main conflict of the “film” in less than 10 minutes. Obviously, this white English man kills Dwayne Johnson, and finds the magical “Tears” that Emily Blunt’s character searches for to validate her career. Unfortunately, the onscreen tears cannot match the collective tears of the audience who wasted $30 to watch this in their home.
In conclusion, this movie sucks, and I know this because I watched nothing but the trailer and a 5 minute review on YouTube in the background of a much better movie, The Green Inferno. 2/10

Parasite Review
Rating: The perfect 10 


It isn’t every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don’t worry, this review won’t have any spoilers whatsoever. 


To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities. 


A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs. 


Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie. 


The plot of this movie is something I’ve yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming. 


At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind’s strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn’t in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life. 


Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats.

*SPOILER* 365 Days... Could have been 2.5 Days
 I just noticed this movie yesterday on Netflix Canada and gave it a try since the leading man seemed hot... That was my first mistake.

The lead male character is indeed hot, but not much else is worth watching in this movie. I watched it yesterday, and my brain is still mad at me for giving it such garbage to digest.

The plot makes absolutely no sense from the start. It feels like this was a collage of 5 different people’s first draft ideas, put together by the lowest bidder. Here's just a few particularly bad parts of the script (not exhaustive list, it would be too long):

* Massimo seeing Laura on the beach with his binoculars, only to be haunted by this image after being shot. He had seen her a few seconds with binoculars but somehow he had a good enough recollection of her face to have her portrait made (in his bedroom!), and it is as good as a picture would have been!
* When Massimo finds Laura, he just decides to kidnap her instead of trying to seduce her. This is weird because they make it clear from the start that her boyfriend is a schmuck. If Massimo had just opened the door of that car and asked her if she wanted a drink she’d have happily jumped in, without looking back.
* The “weak heart” thing is lame. Nobody seems to think about that anymore when she’s bouncing on his d\*\*k for a whole day on that yacht... (where’s his associate gone by the way?)
* The shopping trip he takes her on is ridiculously long and pointless, as if scripted by a 16yo
* He tells her he wants her to fall in love with him yet holds her captive for no reason, really... Her “rebellion” against him is unconvincing at best. And very quickly it is understood that she’s trying to seduce him. The film is named “365 Days”, it could have been named “2.5 days”, as it is about as long it took for her to loose herself in him completely.
* His behavior is absolutely ridiculous for such a (supposedly) successful mafia boss. The scene in the bar where Laura decides to be as slutty as she can, without knowing who she was dealing with is absolutely stupid and hard to watch. Him becoming completely unhinged and shooting some guy's hands (it is said) makes no sense...
* They introduce Anna, the ex girlfriend, for no reason and lead us to believe Massimo killed her, as asked by Laura. That’s ridiculous and wrong on all levels. It just feels they had this idea of introducing the ex girlfriend, immediately regretted it and killed her to get themselves out of this plot blunder.
* And finally, Massimo... he’s extremely handsome, that’s a given, and it’s nice to have him paired with a less attractive partner. (Oh, she is beautiful, but more in a girl next door kind of way). Anyway, as per the sex scenes, we have to fight really hard to get over the extremely bad dialogues preceding them. Everything they say to each other is cringeworthy (and don’t even get me started on the extremely bad bdsm sub/dom attempt), and you have to forget it to enjoy seeing them going at it.
* The ending feels like it's been thrown together like a dinner made of last week's leftovers, topped with ice cream, with a side of raw onions. In other words, a complete mess... 

I’m sorry, I have to stop here, but it doesn’t even start to describe how bad this movie is. I feel like I've been robbed 2 hours and a good number of neurons...

Malcolm and Marie a tale of toxic Boredom
Emotional? Yes , engaging? Eh. I really waited until I saw the entire film to write but it didn’t change how i felt. When I realized what I signed up for I wanted to cancel the subscription. Simply put this is wack, it’s annoying, and exhausting, but maybe I lack the emotional I.Q to understand. Honestly you can buy a bottle of Henny and go start a fight with your partner and save the trouble of watching this. Two people come home and with no other devices of entertainment they argue all night out of boredom. Did I say something wrong ? Well change my mind. Yes it’s obviously commenting on itself and film making in general, in fact it’s quite meta. Which is something Denzel’s son seems to enjoy in the movies he leads, but damn I don’t want to hear him yelling at me anymore. Have you ever had to take a deep sigh when talking to someone to release stress they’re creating inside you? Well you gonna be doing that a lot here. My perspective, he should have been fucking her as soon as they got home but I understand this is an artistic film. However they could have just went in separate rooms to stop the unnecessary drawn out toxic exchange. I didn’t need to see this in Netflix I can do this on my own.

A review going over Joker because I feel I have a kinda unpopular opinion feel free to ask about my takes.
I will go through every aspect of movie for this.

Characters: 6/10 Joker was the only one even close to great.

Story: 5/10 I feel that the base story wasn't that good but instead was helped out by other factors like music acting and visuals.

Visuals: 10/10 Amazingly shot and stylized.

Music: 9/10 Atmospheric.

Writing: 7.5/10

Overall I think Joker is a 7/10 movie.

The Joker 2019 (No Spoiler Review)
I'm not sure if the No Spoiler is needed.  As a comic book movie,  it's just another origin movie for another villian to another comic superhero for another comic franchise.

If you've been reading twitter or the news, apparently it's pro-trump, anti-trump, gun violence sympathiser, liberal anti gun agenda, pro mental health and a movie that makes light of mental health. It's just a movie. 

Remove the Batman lore and It tells a story of a man, living in poor and unfortunate circumstances, in a tough part of town, during a rough period for many people slowly descending into madness. 

It shows a society finally snapping after being stretched beyond their limits. Their sick, their tired and gap between the elitist and the "others" are growing. 

It's a mirror to society. Funnily the same real qorld society that's currently throwing a fit over a movie.  A society so corrupted an bewildered by their many issues that they don't seem to function properly anymore. 

Overall, a brilliant movie to watch. It's a good story and the actors are good. The direction and story felt just right. Nothing over the top. Nothing to preachy. It's just a story well filmed.

I Just Saw Us and... (Potential spoilers)
I'm deeply disappointed. I'm not gonna sugar coat it, this was not me cup of tea. I'm still over here trying to process what I saw. Im just not sure if I liked this movie or if I wasted my money. The begining was good. The movie was beautifully shot and the scenes we're composed wonderfully. I was genuinely interested the entire time, especially when the dopplegangers came on screen. However the payoff was not worth it at all.  Everything about the dopplegangers felt like an unfinished thought. Like Jordan didn't have enough time to go into details about certain things. There's nothing wrong with ambiguity but it's falls short when you half explain it and then never revisit it. And goddamn the fucking movie itself is so pretentious! As far as the social commentary goes it's skin deep as fuck. "We are our own worst enemy" is the same shit everyone has been saying since the fucking trailer dropped. It hardly touches on anything that isn't obvious as fuck. There's a little bit of commentary on class differences but it hardly goes anywhere because 

[SLIGHT WARNING] all they do is fucking stab people with scissors. 

The explanation behind all of  this is fucking stupid. When you get to the climax and the big secret behind the clones are brought to light; I found it extremely underwellming. It only went on to raise more questions about the actual plot; We know we know where they came from... But why???  Then there's the plot twist that I personally felt was a tad obvious to anyone who payed hard enough attention. Not only that, it did add another layer to the movie but it just wasn't impactful at all still raises a few questions to be honest. Had to get that off my chest as I'm still digesting this. Can't even rate it, I'm so ... I don't even know...
